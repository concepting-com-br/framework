Synopsis
========

The main goal of this framework is provide a fast, simple, reliable and standardized way to develop Web Applications.
The development was started in 2006 and since then new features and improvements are being released constantly.

Motivation
==========

In my nearly 20 years of experience in software development, I faced the same problems in different companies. Some of these problems are listed below:

1. Code with lack of standards and reuse.
2. Different versions for different environments.
3. Hard-coded and/or non synchronized persistence layer with the data models.
4. Hard-coded and/or non synchronized integration layer with the business layer.
5. Poor and non-customizable UI.

The framework came up to mitigate these problems and many others and also speed up the development, consequently provide faster and more reliable deliveries.

Contribution
============

If you want to contribute with us, just fork the project that is located in BitBucket ([https://bitbucket.org/concepting/framework](https://bitbucket.org/concepting/framework)) and then make a pull request. We will analyze your code and check if it can be incorporated as soon as possible. You can also report a bug or request a new feature.

Supported Versions
==================

* [latest](https://bitbucket.org/innovativethinking/framework) ![Run Status](https://api.shippable.com/projects/5ae3c2da5bc21c0600b41570/badge?branch=master)
* [3.7.0](https://bitbucket.org/innovativethinking/framework/src/master) ![Run Status](https://api.shippable.com/projects/5ae3c2da5bc21c0600b41570/badge?branch=master)

Installation
============

The pre-requisites to use the framework are:

1. **Java Development Kit 1.8.x** (It works with prior version but you'll need to recompile it with backward compatibility).
2. **Gradle 5.6.2** (You must put the ant executable in your PATH environment variable).

To start using the framework, you should clone the project from BitBucket and then import it into your IDE.
Now I'm using Eclipse IDE for JEE Developers (NEON Version). This IDE already has an integration with BitBucket but if you use an another tool and it doesn't have a BitBucket integration, you should use the git client. To clone the repository just run the command below:

`git clone git@bitbucket.org:innovativethinking/framework.git`

After the cloning, you can choose the version that you want to work.
To use the development version (Unstable), execute the command below:

`git checkout master`

To use the last version (Stable), execute the command below:

`git checkout 3.7.0`

Or use the IDE to switch between the versions.
